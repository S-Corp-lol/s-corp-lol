        <strong>S Corpâ„¢</strong> is a parody certification for startups that
        want to feel ethical without the hassle of doing anything meaningful. It
        proudly offers zero audits, zero impact, and maximum vibes.

        This site was built by a developer who got annoyed while reading about
        real certifications and decided to build something profoundly unserious
        instead. It's free. It does nothing. That's the point.

        Honestly, the certificate is more legit than most Web3 pitches.
