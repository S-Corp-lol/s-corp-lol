# ðŸ§¾ S Corp â€” The World's Most Superficial Certification

S Corpâ„¢ is a parody certification platform for startups that want to feel ethical without the hassle of doing anything meaningful.

No audits. No accountability. Just vibes and a downloadable certificate.

This site is satire.
The certificate is real.
The impact is imaginary.

##Â Features
* Generates meaningless PDF certificates instantly
* Fake testimonials from fake startups with fake titles
* Zero friction, zero cost, zero substance

Built with Comnoco, React, Tailwind, and a healthy disrespect for greenwashing

## Why?
Because some certifications cost $30K and still donâ€™t mean anything.
We just skipped the pretense.
